## About

This project is part of the a free code week provide by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). In this week the main point is to teach how to built a fullstack Application. So it is teached NodeJS, React and React Native in order to deal with all parts of a complete project.

This specific project has the main goal to help ONGs. So it was built an application where the ONGs can store and spread their incidents. It can store info about each incident and the value each ONG needs to deal with the incident so anyone who is interested in help can contribute.
